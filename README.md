Onyo is a text-based inventory system built on top of git. It uses the filesystem as
the index and git to track history. This allows much of Onyo's functionality to
be just a thin wrapper around git commands.

## Use

See the documentation for [installation instructions](https://onyo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
and general information about Onyo.

### Installation

#### Non-Python Dependencies

Onyo requires Python >= 3.11 and a few system utilities.

Debian/Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install git tig python3-pip
```

macOS:
```
brew install git tig
```

#### Setup and activate virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/onyo
source ~/.venvs/onyo/bin/activate
```

Enabling tab-completion is also recommended:
```
source <(onyo shell-completion)
```

## Demo

An [example Onyo repository](https://github.com/psyinfra/onyo-demo/) is
available. It's easier to get a feel for how Onyo works with a populated
repository with actual history, rather than starting from scratch. Just install
Onyo, clone the demo repo, and start poking around!
